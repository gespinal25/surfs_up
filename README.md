# 1.	Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to show the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu to see if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

# 2.	Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
According to the data three major points from the two analysis deliverables are maximum, mean, and minimum of the temperatures between the two months. For the month of June, the hottest day recorded was 85 degrees F and in December it was listed as 83 degrees F, great day for business and surfing. The mean for both months are for June is 75 and in December is 71, four-degree difference, the averages is not a bad day to get some ice cream and do some surfing especially on a sunny day. The minimum temperature for both months, eight-degree difference of June being 64 degrees and December being 56 degrees. Probably not greatest day for surfing but a good day to eat ice cream if you donâ€™t want it to melt as fast compared to a hot day.

# 3.	Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
Two additional queries that I would perform to gather more weather data for June and December is to record how long the heat waves might last and as well record total rainfall. I personally would take advantage of these climate changes and try to create sales for those upcoming days to cover the days that sales are not of standard.
